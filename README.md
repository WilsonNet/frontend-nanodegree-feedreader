# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company. So I added additional tests to the Test Suite.

## Installation

You can clone the repository with this command line:

```git
git clone https://github.com/WilsonNet/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```

Or you can simply download the .zip using [this link](https://github.com/WilsonNet/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/archive/master.zip). Then unzip it in a folder of your choice. 

## Usage

Just run the index.html file and you are good to go.
You should see all tests passing, if you want to edit them you can using the file feedreader.js (**./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js**).
